# Hyperparameter-Tunning
The "Hyperparameter Tuning" repository hosts code for tuning hyperparameters across multiple Machine Learning models. 

This repository provides resources and code snippets for tuning hyperparameters of various Machine Learning models. It covers a range of tuning methodologies aimed at optimizing the performance and accuracy of the models, especially Logistic Regression.

Contents
Manual Tuning: Basic method for tuning hyperparameters.
Random Search: An optimized method to search through the hyperparameter space.
Grid Search: A systematic way of going through different hyperparameters to find the best combination.
Automated Tuning using Hyperopt Library: A modern way to automatically tune hyperparameters using the Hyperopt library.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. The code snippets can be run in a local development environment set up with the necessary libraries and dependencies.
